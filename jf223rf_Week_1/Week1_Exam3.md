## About Myself

Hi! My name is Jonathan and I am beginning the CS program this fall. I'm lokking forward to getting to know everyone.
Last August I moved to Kalmar from Gothenburg, bringing about a lot of change.

The last 12 months I have been working at the retailer ++Nordic Nest\*\* in the Customer Care Department, taking on various task. Most recently I have been working as Shipment specialist handling all the complicated cases regarding customer deliveries.

Since April I have been practicing some _Javascript_ on and off to get a feel for how these upcoming years will proceed. The things I find most interesting about programming is the following, from most to least interesting:

1. Problem solving
2. APIs
3. Working with JSON Files

Things I havestruggled with,but hope to get more comfortable with is:

- Using the correct syntax
- Writing fast
- Writing without mistakes

## Code Snippet

```javascript
{
  const number = prompt('Enter a number: ');

  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    console.log('The number is even.');
  } else {
    console.log('The number is odd.');
  }
}
```
